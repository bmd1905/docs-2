## Best Practices

**Include cluster context:**
```
✅ @kai analyze our production EKS cluster in us-west-2 for pod resource optimization and scaling improvements
❌ @kai check our containers
```

**Specify environment details:**
```
✅ @kai review staging cluster autoscaling policies for our microservices workloads with 10-100 replicas
❌ @kai optimize our Kubernetes
```

**Define success metrics:**
```
✅ @kai improve cluster resource utilization while maintaining <30 second pod startup time and 99.9% SLA
❌ @kai make our cluster better
```

## Configuration

**Supported Platforms:** Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS, Self-managed Kubernetes
**Required Tools:** `#alert`, `#recommend`, `#dashboard`, `#chart`, `#report`
**Connections:** Kubernetes clusters with monitoring and metrics access

## Getting Started

1. Connect your Kubernetes clusters for comprehensive analysis
2. Start with: `@kai analyze our Kubernetes cluster health and identify top optimization opportunities`
3. Review optimization plan with implementation priorities and expected outcomes
4. Use dashboards and automated monitoring for continuous cluster optimization
