# Knowledge Base

Create knowledge bases to store and organize documents that your AI agents can access and reference. This enhances your agents' capabilities by providing them with your organizational knowledge and procedures.

## Creating Knowledge Bases

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click New">
    Click the "New" button to create a knowledge base
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Title & Description">
    Give your knowledge base a clear, descriptive name and brief description
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Access Level">
    Choose "Private" for personal use or "Team/Workspace" for sharing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Usage Mode">
    Select "Manual" for on-demand access or "Always" for automatic inclusion
  </Step>

## Using Knowledge with Agents

Once created, your agents can use knowledge bases in two ways:

### Manual Search
Use `#kb` to find specific information:

```
@tony please #kb for PostgreSQL performance tuning
@oliver #kb search our security knowledge base for incident response
```

### Always Available
If set to "Always" mode, agents automatically reference the knowledge base when relevant.

**Example:**
```
User: What's our process for handling EC2 failures?
Agent: Based on our AWS Operations knowledge base, here's the procedure:
1. Assess impact and affected services
2. Failover to standby instances
3. Notify stakeholders
4. Document the incident
```
