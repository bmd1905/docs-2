- **Agent**: Which AI agent will execute the task
- **Schedule**: When and how often to run

**Example Tasks:**
```yaml
Cost Monitoring Task:
  Name: "Daily Cost Analysis"
  Agent: Alex
  Schedule: Every day at 9:00 AM
  Action: Analyze yesterday's spending and identify anomalies

Security Scan Task:
  Name: "Weekly Security Audit"
  Agent: Oliver  
  Schedule: Every Friday at 6:00 PM
  Action: Scan all resources for vulnerabilities

Database Check Task:
  Name: "Database Performance Review"
  Agent: Tony
  Schedule: Every day at 2:00 AM
  Action: Analyze query performance and identify issues
```

- **Completed Tasks**: Recent successful executions
- **Failed Tasks**: Tasks that need attention
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Upcoming task executions

### Task Results

Each task execution provides:
- **Success/Failure Status**: Whether the task completed successfully
- **Execution Duration**: How long the task took to complete
- **Key Findings**: Important insights or issues discovered
- **Recommendations**: Suggested actions based on results
- **Next Steps**: Follow-up tasks or manual actions needed
