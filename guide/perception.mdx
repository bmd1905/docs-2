**Quick Tips:**
- Start with `@alex #dashboard cost analysis` to see how it works
- Use specific descriptions like "monthly AWS spending" instead of just "costs"
- Try both #dashboard and #report with the same data to see different views
- Beta features (#slide, #web) are experimental but fun to try
